SPEECH TO TEXT
 In your activity, call the startListening method to begin speech recognition, and implement the necessary logic in the onResults method to process the recognized speech text.
 You can start the speech recognition by calling startListening() method from your activity. Once the user finishes speaking, the onResults method will be triggered with the recognized speech text. You can process the recognized text as needed within the onResults method.

 Remember to handle errors and other callback methods according to your app's requirements.

 Note: Speech recognition requires an internet connection, and the availability and accuracy of speech recognition may vary depending on the device and network conditions.

 Please note that the above example demonstrates the basic implementation of speech recognition from a class to an activity. You may need to customize and expand upon it based on your specific requirements.
